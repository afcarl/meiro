  "Sigma (hexagon) maze generation.
  Hexagonal grids connect north to south, northwest to southeast,
  and northeast to southwest. Otherwise, they maintain a rectangular grid,
  so can build upon a core `init`.
  Hexagons stagger across the row, and these algorithms assume [0 0] is
  northwest from [0 1]."
